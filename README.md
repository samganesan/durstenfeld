# durstenfeld  - A durstenfeld shuffler in Go.

This is a Go implementation of the Knuth/Fisher Hayes array Shuffler as modified later by Durstenfeld.

This essentially will shuffle the array front to back to produce a randomly shuffled array

## Getting started

It is written as an interface with two implementations; one for integer arrays and another for string arrays

It is in the process of not just being tested but also expanded to implement a float version as well
